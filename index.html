				<h2>The Game</h2>
				<p>Win Lane/Win Game is designed to be played using a deck of regular playing cards, and you can absolutely play it at your regular games night.</p>
				<p>To win, you need to have the highest total of cards played to more lanes than your opponent.</p>
				<p>To play the game, all you need are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Cards numbered one to five (aces can be used as ones) for both players</li>
					<li>A sixth card, a wildcard for each players. Use jacks if your deck has no wild cards.</li>
					<li>A way to differentiate the three lanes of play. (I have been using a jack, queen and king to assign the lane's area)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Players get one set of the six cards as their opening hand. You should both have identical opening hands.</p>
				<p>Players take turns playing one card from their hand face-down to a lane of their choice. If there is already a facedown card in the lane, that card is flipped face-up, and now revealed to both players.</p>
				<p>Once all cards have been played, flip all remaining face-down cards face-up, and calculate the total value of cards each player has played to each lane, then compare them.</p>
				<p>The wildcard is worth no points by itself, but doubles the value of all other cards you have played to the same lane as it.</p>
				<p>That's it! Play it again and have fun!</p>
